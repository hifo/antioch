            A spellcaster may only have 5 points worth of implements per event. 
            At the magic check-in of an event, the spellcaster may choose how

            the spellcaster must be holding the implement in one hand.

            Any blow that strikes the implement must be taken as if the implement 
            is not there. You can not actively parry with an implement.

            Disenchant, or Disrupt. \nGain the following abilities for 1 point each: 
            \nWhen using a Circle spell you may double the length of the rope. 
            This may only be done once. \nThe AC for Death Watch is changed to 
            “Spellcaster must kneel on one knee holding their Implement with both hands 
            for 60 seconds before being killed.” 
            Additionally, the spell no longer ends when the spellcaster is raised. 
            \nThe spell Death Watch allows the spellcaster to move their head while dead. 
            They still may not speak, try to communicate, or move in any other way while dead. 
            \nGain one additional casting of one of the following spells for 2 points each: 
            Call the Soul, Group Healing, Resist Magic, Animate Undead, or Soul Bane. 
            \nGain the following abilities for 2 points each:

            When this augmentation is first used through Implement, you shall list an alternate build for the familiar. 
            This alternate build can only be changed by learning or unlearning a use of Familiar. 
            From now on, when you use your Familiar and it is augmented by Implement, it uses that new build.

            \nGain the following abilities for 3 points each: 
            \nGain one use of Regeneration. You are not required to know the spell to use this ability 
            \nGain one use of Regeneration. Upon completion, the spellcaster will be
