The spellcaster need not be present in order to use their potions. \nPotions take a 60 second process called Brewing to be cast. At the beginning of an event, the spellcaster must describe in general terms their process of brewing. An alchemist may brew as many potions as their spells allow during the same 60 seconds. If they wish to create more later, they must begin the process again. If the alchemist is interrupted while brewing, Alchemy points are not lost, but the potions will not be made, and they must start over again in order to make any potions. Although not required, use of additional props or role-playing is encouraged for this process. \nNo potion created by a player can carry over from one event to another; it expires at the end of the event at which it is cast. The PC may choose whether or not to further limit the lifespan of a potion when it is brewed by writing a distinct expiration time among the required spell information on the container.

Animating a character who is undead but slain back to their previous type of undead is referred to as “reanimating”. All undead are affected by the spells: Ward: Enchanted Beings, Ward: Undead, and Circle of Protection (unless the person who animated the undead cast the Circle of Protection). Enchanted beings and items still cannot cross a Circle of Protection that is not their own, regardless of undead status. A PC will remember what happened to them while they were an animated undead. A PC may be animated as undead if they are diseased, but this does not cure them of the disease. Unless otherwise specified, an undead can be harmed as per normal and gains no special protections.

The Ward will not keep the targeted creature(s) from walking around the spellcaster to attack others nearby. If the Ward affects them, the targeted creature(s) must stay approximately five feet away from the spellcaster, but need not retreat if the spellcaster advances upon them. To cast a Ward, the spellcaster must hold their spell focus out toward the targeted creatures while repeating the verbal. The verbal needs to make it clear what creatures are affected by the Ward. For example, “Stay back undead. Stay back undead. Stay back undead. Shoo,” would be an appropriate verbal for the Ward: Undead spell. This spell will work for as long as the spellcaster holds out the focus and keeps repeating the verbal. The people playing the targeted creatures must be able to hear what the spellcaster is saying, so it is up to the spellcaster to clearly and loudly chant their verbal. While casting this spell, the spellcaster may not attack the targeted creatures. A being that looks like it should be a targeted creature may not be (or may be immune to the Ward).

While the animal companion is out gathering information the spells provided from the secondary ability are suspended. \nAny additional spells provided by the animal companion require the animal companion to cast and maintain, as if the animal companion were a spell focus.

This spell will mimic a general monster type, and cannot accurately impersonate a named or unique monster, or appear to be another PC. You are free however, to attempt to convince your victims that you are more important than you actually are. \n The shapeshifted form confers no combat benefit or other NPC power, though they can appear to wear armor or carry larger weapons to complete the disguise. You may in no way signal to NPCs that you are NPCing. The shapeshifted form ends if you are killed or if any part of your disguise is disenchanted. \n In addition, at the door of the event, the player is allowed to ask the EH or MM to borrow an appropriate mask for the event in order to complete the illusion. There is no guarantee that they will be able to provide the materials, so you may wish to bring your own."

            "description": "This spell provides an immense amount of protection to the spellcaster, but also requires an immense amount of concentration. This spell only takes effect once the spellcaster has completed the VC once. While transmuted, the spellcaster is completely immune to all forms of damage, magical or otherwise, regardless of whether the material into which the spellcaster transmutes is vulnerable to any form of damage. It does not make the spellcaster invisible or undetectable. The spellcaster must choose what they are capable of attuning to when learning the spell. Choices are: trees, stone, or earth. To transmute, the spellcaster must embrace or lie down on the object they are capable of attuning to (so those who can attune to trees hug a tree, to stone lie on or hug a rock, or to earth lie on the ground). While transmuted, the spellcaster is “stuck” and cannot be dragged. The object the spellcaster attunes with MUST be at least as massive as the spellcaster. The spellcaster must keep their eyes closed and remain perfectly still, and they must be constantly chanting their verbal while transmuted. The spellcaster must chant loudly and clearly. If anything interrupts the spellcaster’s concentration, the spell is broken. OOC explanations (such as combat calls) do not interrupt this spell. For example, if a PC chanting a Transmute Self spell is hit by a weapon, they may call “No effect” without interrupting the spell. As soon as the spellcaster moves, opens their eyes, or stops chanting, the spell ends. The spellcaster may not transmute for at least one slow 200 second count after regaining their proper form. The spellcaster must use their common sense when deciding where to transmute. Pick a safe location, not the middle of a trail or a high combat area."
